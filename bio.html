            <h3>My Journey</h3>
            <p>I began my academic journey studying Computer Science, where I developed a strong foundation in programming, data analysis, and problem solving.
            Over time, I realized that technology alone isn’t enough — the most impactful products come from the blend of design, creativity, and human understanding.
            That realization led me to pursue my master’s degree at the University of Southern California’s Iovine and Young Academy (IYA), where I’m now exploring how design thinking and creative technology can come together to build smarter, more meaningful digital experiences.</p>

            <h3>Exploring the World</h3>
            <p>Travel has always been my favorite way to discover inspiration.
            Since coming to the United States, I've visited Boston, Rochester, New York, Washington D.C., Miami, Los Angeles, Dallas, San Antonio, Kansas City, San Francisco, and Sacramento — each place offering a new story, new people, and new perspectives.
            If time allows, I hope to explore even more cities and national parks, capturing moments that remind me how vast and creative the world truly is.</p>

            <h3>Games and Imagination</h3>
            <p>In my free time, I love diving into video games — from Valorant to Baldur's Gate 3, from Pokémon to The Legend of Zelda.
            Games to me are more than entertainment — they are immersive worlds built through code, design, and storytelling, the same blend I strive to bring into my own creative projects.</p>

            <h3>Music and Creativity</h3>
            <p>Music has been another major part of my life.
            I've played in a wind band, performing the saxophone and bassoon, and even formed a small band with friends where I was the keyboardist.
            I also enjoy playing piano, and in the next two years I plan to learn guitar — not for performance, but as another way to understand rhythm, harmony, and emotional expression.
            Music constantly reminds me that creativity comes from collaboration, patience, and emotion — the same principles that guide my design and software work.</p>

            <h3>Sports and Passion</h3>
            <p>I've loved basketball since childhood — the rhythm, the teamwork, the energy of the game.
            I also enjoy badminton, and I follow both NBA and MLB closely.
            There are many players I admire, but Russell Westbrook stands out most — not just for his skills, but for his relentless drive and passion, qualities I also try to bring into everything I do.</p>

            <h3>Strategy and Connection</h3>
            <p>When I'm not coding or playing sports, I enjoy board games — especially strategic and social ones like Werewolf.
            They're more than games; they're opportunities for creative thinking, teamwork, and human connection.
            I love how every session brings a different mix of logic, intuition, and surprise — just like building something new from scratch.</p>
